<p align="center"> starting to slowly realise that everyone on this game is a nutjob um. please Dont Talk to me if youre weird or friends with weird people. or friends of friends with weird people lets normalise background checking who people are friends with so ur not talking to someone who supports proshipping or likes weird media or has a history of being a freak Thanks

<p align="center"> my github profile means a lot to me. I check who follows me frquently and it meand a lot of im mentioned in ur bio/profile ðŸ™‚ I usually take it as a sign of Friendship and I get happy when cool people follow me
